        Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. 
        It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, 
        and other interface components.
        Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. 
        It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. 
        It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue.
